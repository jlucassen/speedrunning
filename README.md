# James's Speedrunning Repo

These are quick projects I'm doing mostly to skill up.
Each project will live in its own subfolder, and have its own README.
Each README will be broken up into splits that look like this:

## Split N: Objective
- Target time: 
- Start time:
- Notes:
    - some notes
    - some more notes
- Stop time:
- Split time:
- Debrief notes:
    - wow I was so fast for reasons ABC
    - wow I was so slow for reasons XYZ

I might also upload screencaps of me working on the split.
